# Z170i-Pro-Gaming-OpenCore

## I don't own the hardware right now. If you want to continue this repo please contact me and I'll transfer the ownership. The [HD530 branch](https://github.com/BrushXue/Z170i-Pro-Gaming-OpenCore/tree/HD530) is updated for Monterey. If you have dGPU, you may adjust `config.plist` accordingly.

[中文版本](README_zh-cn.md)



This is an OpenCore version of ASUS Z170i Pro Gaming Hackintosh EFI. It works on macOS Big Sur (11.3.1). FCPX GPU rendering works smoothly. HDR can be enabled. Sleep, Airdrop and Handoff are supported.

## Notes
1. Mac boot chime is added. You may need to modify `config.plist/UEFI/Audio/AudioOut` based you motherboard layout.
2. If you don't have a dGPU, i.e. output via iGPU, refer to [HD530 branch](https://github.com/BrushXue/Z170i-Pro-Gaming-OpenCore/tree/HD530).
3. OpenCanopy and HiDPI are enabled. If you don't own a 4K monitor, disable it in `config.plist/NVRAM/Add/4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14/UIScale`.
4. I chose 15 USB ports in my USB map. 2x USB 3.0(front) + 4x USB 3.0(back) + 2x USB 2.0(back) + Bluetooth(internal via M.2) = 15 ports. Generally there's no front USB 2.0 port on ITX cases so I didn't include onboard USB 2.0 ports(HS11/HS12). I believe this is a reasonable trade-off for most people. However if you bought some strange Wi-Fi card which requires USB 2.0 header, you need follow [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/USB-Map-Guide/) to create your own USB map.
5. For onboard 3.5mm audio output you need to plug into the green(line out) jack. If you restart from Windows, there will be no sound. This is a issue in the Windows Realtek driver as they modified the DSDT. Always shutdown from windows then boot to macOS.

## Known issue
GPU fan spins at max RPM for several seconds during boot occasionally and runs normally in desktop. This is a XFX BIOS bug. The problem can be solved by flashing other similar RX 580 BIOS.
